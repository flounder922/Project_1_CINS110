         You jump out of the bush yelling and flailing around to get the bears
         attention. You roll and dogde while she moves into postition to cast
         the taming dust into the bears face. She throws the dust and hit her
         target. The bear begins to calm and she aproaches speak in a language
         you do not understand. The bear comes to her side and seems to be waiting
         for a command.
