      <p>
         You decide that your quest is more important to get done, so you tell
         the warrior that you will help him with his quest after he helps you
         to complete his. He agrees and you two head for the northern mountains
         You arrive at a diverging path and you have to decide to go through the
         caves or the valley. While the cave is faster it is also dangorous.
         The valley is safer but takes longer.
