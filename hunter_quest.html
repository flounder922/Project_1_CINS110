         You set out on the adventure with the hunter to help her get an animal
         companion. She says that she is looking to tame a brown bear in the
         forest to the east. You set out with her and come to a medow in the
         forest. As you rest there for lunch you notice something moving in the
         bushes. She turns her head to where you are looking and is overcome with
         joy. She grabs the dust from her pouch and approuches the beast. The beast
         turns and leers at you two then begins to roar. The bear drops its head
         and charges like a warrior into combat.
