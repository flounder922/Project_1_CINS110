         When the sun sets you head to the local tavern. You find a seat in the
         back corner. You order mead and a meal of bread and sausage. While you
         wait for the meal and enjoy the mead you scan the tavern to see what
         people are in there with you. You see a number of different people and
         decide that you will take one of them on your quest.
