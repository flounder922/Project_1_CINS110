         The warrior is on a search to find a mighty axe. He leads you to a forest
         to the east. Where you find a massive castle that appears to be falling
         apart. He tells you that the legends say there is a mighty axe made of
         mitheral and imbued with magic. You head in and find resistance from
         monsters. You and the warrior make it to the great hall and see the axe
         sitting on what appears to be a throne, the warrior runs to grab it.
         He lifts it and find that it falls apart in his hands. With great sadness
         he turns to you and says that he will still help on your quest and that
         he knows a shortcut if you wish to use it.
